    <h1>THAALA</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
    Thaala is an inseparable part of music. In music, compositions are composed with thaala and raaga. Thaala enlightens music. Varieties of thaalas in music compositions have paved the way for the variety in music. Any form of music cannot develop without thaala. Even light music, folk music, film music are composed with thaala only. It can be said that thaala is the father of music and raaga is the mother of music. The measuring medium of the speed of music compositions is thaala. There are seven thaalas called as Soolaadhi Saptha Thaalas (सूळादि सप्त ताळम् ). Added to this there are Chaapu Thaalas (छापु ताळस्). The soolaadhi saptha thaalas were created and established through soolaadhi a music compositions. Hence the saptha thaalaas or seven thaalas are called as soolaadhi saptha thaalaas.
    </p>
    <p>
Thaala comprises angaas called as Thaalaangaas. These angaas are the bodies or parts of thaala. These angaas are shown in the counting of thaala by hand gestures. They are laghu, drutha and anudrutha used in soolaadhi thaalaas.

        The point from which the thaala and composition commences is called as graha. It is also called as eduppu. Eduppu is a Tamil word, which means commencement. There are two kinds of graha. They are samagraha and vishamagraha.

        <p>
        When thaala and composition commences simultaneously, it is called as samagraha. Ex: ( lam bo dhara || (geetha-Malahari raga.)

        </p>

        <p>
        When composition starts after counting the thaala i.e. thaala commences before starting the composition, then it is called as Anaagatha graha.
