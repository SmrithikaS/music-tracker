    <h2>COMPOSITIONAL FORMS</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
    Compositional form is the backbone of music. There can be no music without songs. The classical songs are called as the compositional forms. It develops through the varieties of compositions. Raaga and thaala can shine through compositions only. Any raaga gets its identification through the composition. Even extempore music or manodharma sangeetha depends on compositions for presentation. There are two main divisions in compositional forms. They are Abhyaasa gaana or elementary compositions and Sabhaagaana or concert music compositions. Svaraavali (स्वरावळि), geetha, jathisvara, svarajathi are classified as Abhyaasagaana compositions or elimentary compositional forms. Varna (वर्ण) krthi, keerthana, padha, jaavali (जावळि), thillaana and vachana are the concert music compositions or sabhaagaana compositions.

        svaraavali is a Sanskrit word, which means the group or

svaraas like a garland. Saralevarase (सरळेवरसे), Thaarasthaayi varase, Mandhra sthaayi varase, Dhaatu varase, Jantivarase and Alankaras are included in svaraavalis. This can be called as solfa exercise.

order from the thaarashadja. Mandhrasthaayi svaras are given prominence by holding the svaras systematically one by one in each exercise. It reaches the thaarashadja in the end by aarohana krama.

twice with a stroke for the second svara. With a push from the preceding svara. Thus when second "s" is sung 'ss' should be heard as sns. The svara, nishaadha is faintly heard, while striking the second shadja (षड्ज). The arrangement of svaras will be in sequence of ascending order and descending order (aarohana krama and avarohana krama) respectively.

The svara arrangement will be in a sequence in aarohana and avarohana krama i.e. ascending and descending order.

Svaraavalis are composed in Maayamaalava gowla raaga. Except alankaaraas, other svaraavalis are set to Aadhithaala. Svaraavalis are in aksharakaala. Anyhow the svaraavali can be sung in any Janaka Raaga which is a good vocal exercise.

        Krthi is an important compositional form in Karnaataka music. In

general krthi means composition. But krthi is a name given to this form. It has three sections namely pallavi, anupallavi and charana. Chittasvara, a seperate section is added to some krthis, which is sung after anupallavi and charana. Some krthis composed by Dheekshithar has only pallavi and charana. This type of charana is called as samashti charana (समष्टि चरण). Music is given prominence than the saahithya in this form. Minimum words are used. Saahithya is devotional in character. Sangathis are composed to enhance the beauty of this form. Krthis are composed in almost all raagaas and thaalas in different grahas by a large number of composers. The languages used are Telugu, Sankrit, Kannada, Tamil and Malayaalam. Thyaagaraaja, Mutthuswaamy dheekshithar and Shyaamashaasthri are the pioneers in composing krthis.
