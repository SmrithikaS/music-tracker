    <h1>Technical Terms Of Carnatic Music</h1>
    </div>
    <p> Every subject has its technical terms. In Sanskrit these are self explanatory. Hence different languages use the same sanskrit words to explain Indian music. It will be appropriate to use the same technical terms in English also.</p>

'Svathoranjayathi shrothr chittham sa svaramuchyathe'

स्वतो रन्जयति श्रोतु चित्तं स स्वरमुच्यते

Sangeetha Rathnaakara - Shaarangadeva

The sound that is pleasing to the ear is called Svara. Shruthi creates 'Svara'. There are Seven Svaras that are called as Saptha Svaras or seven notes. They are Shadja, rishabha, gaandhaara, madhyama, panchama, dhaivatha and nishaadha. Sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, is the abbreviation used in singing the saptha svaras. While writing music in notation s, r, g, m. p,d,n is used in English language for Indian music only. Svaras are classified into two kinds.
They are prakrthi svara and vikrthi svaras.

        The svaras which is constant is called as Prakrthi Svara. This svara will not have any variety. Shadja and Panchama are prakrthi svaras (s and p)

        The svara having varieties is called as vikrthi svara. Different pitch in the same note or svara comes in vikrthi svara. They are rishabha, gaandhaara, madhyama, dhaivatha and nishaadha.

        <p>
        Sthaayi is a Sanskrit term called octave in English. Sthaayi is a range of vibrations till it is doubled. Number of vibrations doubled will create a different sthaayi. There are three sthaayis. They are Mandhra, Madhya and Thaara sthaayis.

        </li>
        <p>
        The seven svaras from aadhaara shadja in ascending order that is 'srgmp d n' are called madhya sthaayi.

            <strong>MANDHRA STHAAYI :</strong>
            </span>
        </li>
        <p>
        The seven svaras coming downwards from Madhya
        shadja i.e. nd pmgrs are called as Mandhra Sthaayi. The number of vibrations of mandhra shadja is exactly half of the madhya shadja. While writting music in notations dots are placed below the svaras.
        Ex: ndpmgrs
        </p>

            <strong>THAARA STHAAYI:</strong>
            </span>
        </li>
        <p>
        The shadja coming after the nishadha (निषाद) of madhya sthaayi (मध्य स्थयि) is thaara shadja (तार षड्ज). The seven svaras from thaara shadja to nishaadha in ascending order are called as Thaara Sthaayi. The number of vibrations of Thaara shadja is exactly double the Madhya shadja or Aadhaara svara. While writing music in notations dots will be placed above the svaras.
