All the branches of knowledge are called as "Arts" by the ancients. 
Arts can be classified into four branches namely Fine Arts, Creative Arts, Scientific Arts and Commercial Arts. Music, Drama, Dance, Literature, Sculpture, Painting are some of the Fine Arts. Fine Arts is the language of the heart. What language cannot express, it can be easily expressed by Fine Arts. Manufacture of furniture, plastic or glass materials for day to day living and architecture are some of the Creative Arts. All scientific subjects like physics, chemistry, biology and others are considered as Scientific Arts. Trade and its secrets come under Commercial Arts. Thus any branch of knowledge comes under "Arts". Thus Indians classify sixty four arts. Music occupies the first place among Fine Arts. Sound is the medium of expression in music. Music is created by nature with the skill of man. Only human beings are capable of singing and playing music. As such they have developed vocal and instrumental music. Music is as ancient as vedhas. The origin of music is traced from saamavedha and also from the folk music of every region. People sang to express their feelings like sorrow, joy and other moods. Music removes fatigue and gives sound sleep. Even children enjoy music. The little child sleeps by listening to melodious music. All living beings enjoy the bliss of music.
