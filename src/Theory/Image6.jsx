    <h2>SHORT BIOGRAPHY OF VAAGGEYAKAARAS</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
    The role of vaaggaeyakaara is very important in the music world. They are the torch bearers of both lakshya and lakshana i.e. practice and theory of music. One who composes both music and words that is dhaathu and maathu; is called as vaaggaeyakaara "Vaacham gaeyam cha kuruthe yasya saha vaaggaeyakaarakaha" वाचं गेयं च कुरुते यस्य सः वाग्गेयकारकः is the explanation given for vaaggaeyakaara by Shaarngadeva. He classifies them into four categories as utthama, madhyama, adhama and kuttikaara. Shaarngadeva mentions certain qualities of vaaggaeyakaara. The composer having all these qualities is considered as utthama vaaggaeyakaara or the best composer. Madhyama vaaggaeyakaara composes good music i.e.dhaathu with medium saahitya i.e. maathu. Adhama vaaggaeyakaara is the composer who composes music to the words of other poet. Kuttikaara is a composer where in both words and music is of inferior quality. Shree Purandharadhaasa, Shree Thyaagaraaja, Shree Mutthuswaamy Dheekshithar and Shree Shyaamasaasthri are hailed as genius composers.

      <h2 className='header'>1. SHREE PURANDHARADHAASA (1484-1564 A.D.)</h2>
        <p>
        Shree Purandharadhaasa is respected as "Karnaataka Sangeetha Pithaamaha" in world of Karnaataka music. He laid the foundation for the systematic study of Karnaataka Music. Elementary lessons in Maayaamaalava gowļa raaga and aadhi thaala were introduced in karnaataka music. Besides svaraavali and geethas, he composed keerthanaas, padhas, ugaabhogas, soolaadhi, gadhya, vrtthanaama and others. Compositons were composed in Kannada and a few in Sanskrit and set to aadhi, roopaka and chaapu thaalas. His ankitha is Purandhara vitala. He composed in the raagas existing at that time. There were about one hundred raagas only. His compositions are rich in devotion, philosophical thoughts and social aspects. His contribution to karnaataka music is immeasurable.

Varadhappa Naayaka and Lakshmakka were the parents of Purandharadhaasa. His father, a maadhwa brahmin, was a dealer of precious gems and jewels. He was a business man at the court of Vijayanagara kingdom.Shreenivaasappa Naayaka was the name given to the child. As a boy he was educated in Sanskrit, Kannada, Music, Vedha, Vedhaangas, Upanishad and Puraana (पुराण). Later he took up his father's profession namely. Diamond and gems business. He married Saraswathi and had four children. He chanted nine crores of Naaraayana manthra (नारायण मन्त्र). Perhaps that is the reason he is called as Navakoti Naaraayana (नवकोटि नारायण).

Shreenivasappa nayaka was the richest man in Vijayanagar, but a miser by nature. Once a miracle happened in his life. God in the disguise of an old brahmin pleaded for financial help for a good cause. He refused. The old man approached his wife. Being a generous lady she offered her diamond nose ring to the old brahmin. In order to test Naayaka the old brahmin brought this jewel to Naayaka for sale. Naayaka immediately recognized the nose ring of his wife. He rushed to his house and demanded her to give the nose ring. She was desperate. She prayed God to save her. Immediately she got back her nose ring and gave this to her husband. He was astonished! How she could get back the jewel which he kept in the safelock? He realized that acquiring wealth should not be the motto of life. Immediately he renounced everything saying "Krishnaarpana masthu.” (ऋष्णार्पण मस्तु)

Naayaka left the house with his wife and children to have the darshan of Lord Purandharavitala. He had the blessings of Guru Vyaasaraayaswami. He initiated him to be a dhaasa and named him Purandharadhaasa. Dhaasa started his unchavrtthi, receiving alms in the form of rice and others from the devotees.while going for unchavrtthi he composed songs and sang them. He played his thamboora with a thaala in left hand and tied the gejje (noopura) in the foot. He went on composing songs in praise of God. Thus he could educate women and children through his keerthanas and ugaabhogas. People were attracted by his music. Everybody started singing his songs called dhaevara naamas. Thus he spread music all over the state of Karnaataka. Thus established Karnaataka music in South India.
He composed nearly four lakh seventyfive thousand compositions as stated by Sri Vijayadhaasa in a keerthana. Guru Vyaasaraaya composed a keerthana 'Dhaasarendhare purandhara dhaasaryya in appreciation of his disciple. He recognised Purandharadhaasa's entire work as "Purandharopanishad."
Thus he lived a purposeful life of eighty years. He spent fifty years of his life in composing music. On pushya bahula amaavaasye he shook off his mortal life. He is remembered always by musicians and music lovers. Shree Purandharadhaasa aaraadhana is celebrated in January in the grand scale in Karnaataka especially at Mulabaagilu.
